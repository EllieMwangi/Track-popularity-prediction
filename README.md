# Spotify track popularity prediction

### Understanding Context

Spotify Technology is a Swedish music streaming and media services provider that provides an audio streaming platform, the "Spotify" platform, that offers DRM-restricted music and podcasts from record labels and media companies. 
The Spotify platform provides access to over 50 million tracks. Users can browse by parameters such as artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists. 

The service is available in most of Europe and the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Africa and Asia, and on most modern devices, including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers, and iOS, and Android smartphones and tablets.

With this project, Spotify management seeks to meet the following objectives:
- Identify popular songs early on to upload them on the platform
- Identify any new emerging genres of music

### Data Used
 The data for this project comes from Spotify via the spotifyr package by Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and Tom Wolff. It is thus appropriate for answering the research question.

### Analysis Objectives
1. Build a track popularity prediction model. Model performance to measured using RMSE and R-squared scores
2. Identify clusters with clear boundaries in track data
